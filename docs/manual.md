## Story

Cells at Home is a Minecraft map inspired by the anime Cells at Work. It revolves around an antropomorphism of the cells inside the human body. In this map you can play as either red or white cells, or as pathogens.
The red and white cells are keeping the body alive while pathogens try to ruin that.  
This is an exciting battle game that can be played with 3 or more players on multiplayer or LAN.

## Controls

### Lobby Controls

## Red Cells

### Goal
Deliver sandwiches to target cells within time.

### Info
Above your hotbar, it tells you how many sandwiches you need, how much time you have and roughly where the delivery should be made (the arrow)
The cell you have to deliver to will have a note above their head. Press Right Click to finish your delivery.  
Return to the guts (where you initially started) to get more sandwiches.
Try not to get killed by the pathogens. White cells should protect you!

## White Cells
### Goal
Protect the red cells by killing pathogens and cure/kill infected cells.

### Info
Use your sword to kill pathogen players. For each kill you get a cure, which you can use on infected cells to heal them.  
You can also kill infected cells, if you have no cure. Infected cells have green puffs surrounding them, be sure to get rid of them, or the pathogens will overrun the body!

## Pathogens
### Goal
Try to disrupt the blood cells, by killing them and use the nutrients you receive from them to infect and kill cells.

### Info
Use your sword to kill red and white cells. By stealing enough sandwiches from killing red cells, you receive an item to transform cells into infected cells by throwing it on alive cells.\\n Killing healthy cells takes a long time, but baby cells and infected cells are much more vulnerable!\\nYou can use a net to slow down blood cells to make it easier to kill them!

## All Classes
### Main Goal:
Blood Cells vs Pathogens. The blood cells win by delivering nutrients to target cells to increase the amount of alive cells. The pathogens win by killing/infecting cells. The bars on the top of the screen show the amount of alive and infected cells.

### Coffee:
You can find coffee hidden in coffee machines all over the map to gain a huge speed boost when used.

### Healing:
You can heal in your base, pathogens need to stand on the purple concrete to heal.
