# cells-at-home
Cells at Home is a Minecraft Group Project for Game Studies and Analysis at Leiden University.  
It takes inspiration from Cells at Work! (the anime)  
The goal of the game Cells at Home! is simple. The blood cells have to defend the body against the pathogens.  
You choose to play as the red or white cell to deliver nutrients or to kill pathogens.  
If you choose to play the pathogen, your goal is to cause chaos, make the body so weak that it is virtually defeated.

This is a 3+ player game and runs (tested) in Minecraft 1.15.2 and above (untested).

## Installation
To install the map, simply clone the git repository into a new world folder under your saves. Run on LAN or a dedicated server, make sure to have the server properties set to `enable-commandblocks=true` and `function-permission-level=2` (2 or higher).

For more information, there are tons of guides online on how to install, download, port-forward, you-name-it.

## Documentation
You can find more info specific to our project in the `docs` folder.

- About tool usage: `tools-info.txt`
- Code style/conventions: `conventions.txt`
- Minecraft Installation Guide: `How to play Minecraft.pdf`
- In-game manual (converted to markdown): `manual.md`
- Information about the graphs (from statistical analysis): `graphs.txt`

The folders `data`, `poi`, `region` and the file `level.dat` make up the minecraft world files, which includes the architecture and level design. Screenshots of the level are provided in the docs folder, in case you are unable to view the level.  
The folder `datapacks` contains all the custom written code for all the game logic.

## Code
Any code can be found in the datapacks folder.  
Comments have been used here and there to aide the reader. (however it takes some skill to read mcfunction files)
