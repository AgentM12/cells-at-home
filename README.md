# cells-at-home
Cells at Home is a Minecraft Group Project for Game Studies and Analysis at Leiden University.  
It takes inspiration from Cells at Work! (the anime)  
The goal of the game Cells at Home! is simple. The blood cells have to defend the body against the pathogens.  
You choose to play as the red or white cell to deliver nutrients or to kill pathogens.  
If you choose to play the pathogen, your goal is to cause chaos, make the body so weak that it is virtually defeated.

This is a 3+ player game and runs (tested) in Minecraft 1.15.2 and above (untested).

To install the map, simply clone the git repository into a new world folder under your saves. Run on LAN or a dedicated server, make sure to have the server properties set to `enable-commandblocks=true` and `function-permission-level=2` (2 or higher).
