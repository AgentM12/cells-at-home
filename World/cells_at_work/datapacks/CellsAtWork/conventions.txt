Game is a state machine:

Namespace:
 - Any custom stuff goes into caw namespace.
 - Any core game mechanics have to go into minecraft.

Function separation:
 - functions that mimic known commands such as 'kill', 'give', 'clear', should go in a folder as such.
 - State specific functions go in the folder called '<state>', register states in 'state' folder.
 - main folder should handle all initialization and core load and tick functions.

Sections within functions:
 - Use comments to denote specific sections.
 - ### Triple ### comments denote main sections (pre, main, post, reset, init, etc.)
 - # Single comments give a certain command sequence 'kill' kill item, kill villager etc.

Code Style:
 - Use 'self' tag explicitly for tagging the current object when @s will point to something else, do not nest these!
 - Tags should be added

Mechanics:
 - AntiCheat: leavers have to be handled gracefully upon rejoining.
 - States: The game runs in state 'game' and accepts players in 'lobby', these are entirely separate.
 - IntegrityCheck: Verifies that all game objects are present, before starting a game.
 - PlayerLimit: Checks if the amount of players per team and as a whole matches the limits.
